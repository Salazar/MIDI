1.  Lights for Play, Record, Stop and '>' buttons.
    '>' is programmed for PAT/SONG toggle, so it should be orange when in Pattern mode and Green when in Song Mode.
    Play and Record should be in bright white when active. Play should dim when paused and colorless when stopped.
    Stop should be red and flash once in white/green when pressed.

2.  Currently, the 8 knobs are controlling the mixer track volumes from the selected mixer track to the 8th track from the selected track.
    If the selected track is 5th then it will control volumes of track number 5 to 12 (8 in total).
    Task is to add some kind of switch that toggle the knobs to change panning value instead of volumes.
